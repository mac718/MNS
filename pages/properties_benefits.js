          Properties and benefits of the oils and Butters I Use in my Soap
        </Heading>
        <p>
          <strong>
            I use a wide range of oils and butters in my cold and hot processed
            soaps. Though all of them are great for the skin and hair, they each
            have their own role to play in the soaps and shampoo bars that
            contain them.
          </strong>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Avocado Oil</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - A light, gentle oil that is full of vitamins (A, B1, B2, D, E, and
          lecithin) and essential fatty acids. It&apos;s absorbed very readily,
          leaves no greasy residue, and soothes, moisturizes, and heals dry,
          itchy, flaky skin, hair, and scalps. Due to its skin-soothing and
          regenerating properties, it&apos;s said to be beneficial to those who
          suffer from eczema, psoriasis, and sun-damaged skin.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Beef Tallow</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - Rendered beef fat. Tallow is rich in vitamin A and produces a
          creamy, hard, gentle, moisturizing bar of soap. It&apos;s a
          particularly effective addition to shaving soap, where it imparts an
          unparalleled creaminess to the shaving lather. Though I do like to use
          tallow in some of my soaps, most of my formulations are vegan
          friendly.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Castor Oil</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - A thick, viscous, very moisturizing oil that imparts an effusive
          creaminess and bubbliness to soap. It&apos;s a great addition any
          soap, but particularly to shampoo bars for its ability to create a
          satisfying, fluffy lather as well as its extreme conditioning
          attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Coconut Oil</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - Solid below temperatures of 76 degrees, this oil is one of the few
          that offers significant cleansing properties due to its high lauric
          acid content. However, as a result, too much can be drying, since it
          has the potential to strip the skin of its natural oils. But, used
          judiciously, it is very skin-friendly. It also imparts hardness and a
          nice fluffy lather to each bar.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Kokum Butter</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - A highly prized hard, dense, emollient vegetable butter of Indian
          origin derived from the fruit of the Garcinia tree. Kokum butter
          possesses many characteristics similar to cocoa butter (high vitamin E
          content, promotes skin regeneration and elasticity, imparts a
          luxuriant creaminess to soap lather), but is non-comedogenic (does not
          clog pores). It&apos;s wonderful stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Olive Oil</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - An oil with a long soaping history, olive oil provides great
          conditioning for the skin and is extremely mild. Soap made with 50%
          olive oil or more is known as castile soap, named after the region of
          Spain in which it was allegedly invented.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Palm Oil</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - Palm oil is a great soap base in combination with other oils that
          lends hardness and a stable, creamy lather to soaps.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Safflower Oil</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - A very light, silky, highly moisturizing, and gentle oil that
          promotes a stable lather.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Shea Butter</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - One of the most renowned soaping and cosmetic butters in existence
          (for good reason), shea butter is an off-white, fairly soft, vegetable
          butter derived from the fruit of karite tree. It&apos;s full of
          vitamins A, E, and F, all of which promote skin and hair regeneration.
          My shea butter is unrefined to ensure that all of its properties are
          intact. It&apos;s a highly moisturizing butter that has historically
          been used to treat/mitigate a wide host of ailments such as eczema,
          psoriasis, sun burn, scars, stretch marks, wrinkles, insect bites, and
          even small wounds. In addition to its healing properties, shea butter
          provides deep conditioning for the skin and hair. This conditioning
          improves skin softness and elasticity, reduces dandruff, and adds
          luster, strength, and softness to hair.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Stearic Acid</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - This is an acid that is found in other oils and butters, most
          prominently in shea, mango, kokum, and cocoa butters, and beef tallow
          (however, my stearic acid is ENTIRELY OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN) that adds
          creaminess and hardness to soap. I use this in my shaving soaps and
          some shampoo bars to enhance the texture of the lather.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            <u>Vegetable Glycerin</u>
          </strong>{" "}
          - A viscous, clear, emollient humectant derived from vegetable lipids.
          Glycerin is a byproduct of soap-making and is naturally present in
          soap (however, big soap companies deliberately remove the glycerin
          from their soap to sell separately). It&apos;s highly moisturizing and
          does not saponify (turn into soap). I typically use a small amount of
          glycerin as a medium in which to mix my pigments, but don&apos;t add
          too much in addition to what occurs naturally to my bath soaps, as too
          much additional glycerin would compromise the feel and texture of the
          soap. Where extra glycerin really shines, though, is in shaving soap,
          where its humectant properties help keep your beard nice and hydrated
          throughout the shave. In addition, glycerin makes shaving lather
          stronger and less subject to breakdown.
